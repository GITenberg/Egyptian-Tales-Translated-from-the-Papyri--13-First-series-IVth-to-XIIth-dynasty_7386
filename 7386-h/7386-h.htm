      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">IT is strange that while literature occupies so
      much attention as at present, and while fiction is the largest division of
      our book-work, the oldest literature and fiction of the world should yet
      have remained unpresented to English readers. The tales of ancient Egypt
      have appeared collectively only in French, in the charming volume of
      Maspero's "Contes Populaires" ; while some have been translated into
      English at scattered times in volumes of the "Records of the Past." But
      research moves forward ; and translations that were excellent twenty years
      ago may now be largely improved, as we attain more insight into the
      language.</span>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font15">2 INTRODUCTION</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">For another reason also there is a wide ground for
      the present volume. In no case have any illustrations been attempted, to
      give that basis for imagination which is all the more needed when reading
      of an age and a land unfamiliar to our ideas. When following a narrative,
      whether of real events or of fiction, many persons&mdash;perhaps most&mdash;find
      themselves unconsciously framing in their minds the scenery and the beings
      of which they are reading. To give a correct picture of the character of
      each of the various ages to which these tales belong, has been the aim of
      the present illustrations. A definite period has been assigned to each
      tale, in accordance with the indications, or the history, involved in it;
      and, so far as our present knowledge goes, all the details of life in the
      scenes here illustrated are rendered in accord with the period of the
      story.</span> <span class="font14 c7">To some purely scholastic minds it
      may seem presumptuous to intermingle translations of notable documents
      with fanciful</span>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font14">INTRODUCTION 3</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">illustrations. But, considering the greater
      precision with which in recent years we have been able to learn the
      changes and the fashions of ancient life in Egypt, and the essentially
      unhistorical nature of most of these tales, there seems ample reason to
      provide such material for the reader's imagination in following the
      stories; it may-give them more life and reality, and may emphasise the
      differences which existed between the different periods to which these
      tales refer.</span> <span class="font14 c7">It will be noticed how the
      growth of the novel is shadowed out in the varied grounds and treatment of
      the tales. The earliest is purely a collection of marvels or fabulous
      incidents of the simplest kind. Then we advance to contrasts between town
      and country, between Egypt and foreign lands. Then personal adventure, and
      the interest in schemes and successes, becomes the staple material; while
      only in the later periods does character come in as the groundwork. The</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">same may be seen in English literature&mdash;first
      the tales of wonders and strange lands, then the novel of adventure, and
      lastly the novel of character.</span> <span class="font14 c7">In
      translating these documents into English I have freely used the various
      translations already published in other languages; but in all cases more
      or less revision and retranslation from the original has been made. In
      this matter I am indebted to Mr. F. LI. Griffith, who has in some cases&mdash;as
      in Anpu and Bata&mdash;almost entirely retranslated the original papyrus.
      The material followed in each instance will be found stated in the notes
      accompanying the tales. As to the actual phraseology, I am alone
      responsible for that. How far original idiom should be retained in any
      translation is always a debated question, and must entirely depend on the
      object in view. Here the purpose of rendering the work intelligible to
      ordinary readers required the modifying of some idioms and the
      paraphrasing of others. But so far</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14">INTRODUCTION 5</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">as possible the style and tone of the original has
      been preserved, and whatever could be easily followed has been left to
      speak for itself. In many plainnesses of speech the old Egyptian resembled
      the modern Oriental, or our own forefathers, more than ourselves in this
      age of squeamishness as yet unparalleled in the world. To avoid offence a
      few little modifications of words have been made; but rather than give a
      false impression by tampering with any of the narrative, I have omitted
      the sequel of the last tale and given only an outline of it. The diction
      adopted has been the oldest that could be used without affectation when
      dealing with the early times. It has been purposely modified in the later
      tales; and in the last &mdash;which is of Ptolemaic authorship&mdash;a
      modern style has been followed as more compatible with the later tone of
      the narrative.</span> <span class="font14 c7">For the illustrations Mr.
      Tristram Ellis's familiarity with Egypt has been of good</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">account in his life-like scenes here used. For
      each drawing I have searched for the material among the monuments and
      remains of the age in question. The details of the dresses, the
      architecture, and the utensils, are all in accord with the period of each
      tale. In the tale of Setnau two different styles are introduced. Ahura is
      probably of the time of Amenhotep III., whereas Setnau is a son of Ramessu
      II.; and the change of fashion between the two different dynasties has
      been followed as distinctive of the two persons, one a <i>ka</i> or double
      of the deceased, the other a living man. To the reader who starts with the
      current idea that all Egyptians were alike, this continual change from one
      period to another may seem almost fanciful. But it rests on such certain
      authority that we may hope that this little volume may have its use as an
      object-lesson in practical archaeology.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The
      use and abuse of notes is a matter of dispute. To be constantly

      <span class="font13">INTRODUCTION 7</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font13 c7">reading by some needless and elementary
      explanation is an impertinence both to the author and the reader: the one
      cannot resent it, the other therefore resents it for both. But what is to
      be deemed needless entirely depends on the reader: I have been asked in
      what country Pompei is, as it is not in the English Gazetteer. Rather than
      intrude, then, on the reader when he is in high discourse with the
      ancients, I humbly set up my interpreter's booth next door; and if he
      cares to call in, and ask about any difficulties, I shall be glad to help
      him if I can. Not even numbers are intruded to refer to notes; for how
      often an eager reader has been led off his trail, and turned blithely to
      refer to 37 or 186 only to find, "See J. Z. xxxviii. 377,'' at which he
      gnashed his teeth and cursed such interruptions. So those to whom the
      original tales are obscure are humbly requested to try for some profit
      from the remarks after them, that have been gleaned by the translator.</span>

      <span class="font14 c7">Much might be said by a "folk-lorist"&mdash;in
      proportion to his ardour. But as there are folk-lorists and folk-lorists,
      and the schools of Rabbi Andrew and Rabbi Joseph write different targums,
      I have left each to make his own commentary without prejudice.</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">ONE day, when King Khufu reigned over all the
      land, he said to his chancellor, who stood before him, "Go call me my sons
      and my councillors, that I may ask of them a thing." And his sons and his
      councillors came and stood before him, and he said to them, "Know ye a man
      who can tell me tales of the deeds of the magicians?"</span> <span
      class="font14 c7">Then the royal son Khafra stood forth and said, "I will
      tell thy majesty a tale of the days of thy forefather Nebka, the blessed;
      of what came to pass when he went into the temple of Ptah of Ankhtaui."</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14">KHAFRA'S TALE</span> <span class="font14 c7">"His
      majesty was walking unto the temple of Ptah, and went unto the house of
      the chief reciter Uba-aner, with his train. Now when the wife of Uba-aner
      saw a page, among those who stood behind the king, her heart longed after
      him; and she sent her servant unto him, with a present of a box full of
      garments.</span> <span class="font14 c7">"And he came then with the
      servant. Now there was a lodge in the garden of Uba-aner; and one day the
      page said to the wife of Uba-aner, 'In the garden of Uba-aner there is now
      a lodge; behold, let us therein take our pleasure.' So the wife of
      Uba-aner sent to the steward who had charge over the garden, saying, 'Let
      the lodge which is in the garden be made ready.' And she remained there,
      and rested and drank with the page until the sun went down.</span> <span

      must go and tell Uba-aner of this matter.' Now when this day was past, and
      another day came, then went the steward to Uba-aner, and told him of all
      these things.</span> <span class="font14 c7">"Then said Uba-aner, 'Bring
      me my casket of ebony and electrum.' And they brought it; and he fashioned
      a crocodile of wax, seven fingers long: and he enchanted it, and said,
      'When the page comes and bathes in my lake, seize on him.' And he gave it
      to the steward, and said to him, 'When the page shall go down into the
      lake to bathe, as he is daily wont to do, then throw in this crocodile
      behind him.' And the steward went forth bearing the crocodile.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">"And the wife of Uba-aner sent to the steward who
      had charge over the garden, saying, 'Let the lodge which is in the garden
      be made ready, for I come to tarry there.'</span> <span class="font14 c7">"And
      the lodge was prepared with all good things; and she came and made merry
      therein with the page. And when the even</span>

      was wont to do. And the steward cast in the wax crocodile after him into
      the water; and, behold ! it became a great crocodile seven cubits in
      length, and it seized on the page.</span> <span class="font14 c7">"And
      Uba-aner abode yet seven days with the king of Upper and Lower Egypt,
      Nebka, the blessed, while the page was stifled in the crocodile. And after
      the seven days were passed, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Nebka, the
      blessed, went forth, and Uba-aner went before him.</span> <span
      class="font14 c7">"And Uba-aner said unto his majesty, 'Will your majesty
      come and see this wonder that has come to pass in your days unto a page?'
      And the king went with Uba-aner. And Uba-aner called unto the crocodile
      and said, 'Bring forth the page.' And the crocodile came forth from the
      lake with the page. Uba-aner said unto the king, 'Behold, whatever I
      command this crocodile he will do it.' And his majesty said, 'I pray you

      dancing-girls, and lay in the chamber under their seal." Rud didet said,

      preserved in a single copy, and of that the beginning is entirely lost.
      The papyrus was brought from Egypt by an English traveller, and was
      purchased by the Berlin Museum from the property of Lepsius, who had
      received it from the owner, Miss Westcar: hence it is known as the Westcar
      papyrus. It was written probably in the XIIth Dynasty, but doubtless
      embodied tales, which had been floating for generations before, about the
      names of the early kings. It shows us probably the kind of material that
      existed for the great recension of the pre-monu-mental history, made in
      the time of Seti I. Those ages of the first three dynasties were as long
      before that recension as we are after it; and this must always be
      remembered in considering the authority of the Egyptian records.</span>

      Erman has devoted two volumes to it; publishing the whole in photographic
      facsimile, transcribed in hieroglyphs, transcribed in the modern alphabet,
      translated literally, translated freely, commented on and discussed word
      by word, and with a complete glossary of all words used in it. This
      exhaustive publication is named "Der Marchen des Papyrus Westcar."
      Moreover, Maspero has given a current translation in the "Contes
      Populaires," 2nd edit. pp. 53-86.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The
      scheme of these tales is that they are all told to King Khufu by his sons;
      and as the beginning is lost, eight lines are here added to explain this
      and introduce the subject. The actual papyrus begins with the last few
      words of a previous tale concerning some other magician under an earlier
      king. Then comes the tale of Khafra, next that of Bau-f-ra, and lastly
      that of Hor-dedef.</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">It need hardly be said that these tales are quite
      fictitious. The king and his successor Khafra are real, but the other sons
      cannot be identified; and the confusion of supposing three kings of the
      Vth Dynasty to be triplets born early in the IVth Dynasty, shows what very
      vague ideas of their own history the Egyptians had when these tales were
      formed. This does not prevent our seeing that they embodied some very
      important traditions, and gives us an unequalled picture of the early
      civilisation.</span> <span class="font14 c7">In the earliest tale or the
      three there seems at first sight merely a sketch of faithlessness and
      revenge. But [Page 10] there is probably much more in it. To read it
      aright we must bear in mind the position of woman in ancient Egypt. If, in
      later ages, Islam has gone to the extreme of the man determining</span>

      <span class="font14 c7">his own divorce at a word, in early times almost
      the opposite system prevailed. All property belonged to the woman; all
      that a man could earn, or inherit, was made over to his wife; and families
      always reckoned back further on the mother's side than the father's. As
      the changes in historical times have been in the direction of men's
      rights, it is very unlikely that this system of female predominance was
      invented or introduced, but rather that it descends from primitive times.
      In this tale we see, then, at the beginning of our knowledge of the
      country, the clashing of two different social systems. The reciter is
      strong for men's rights, he brings destruction on the wife, and never even
      gives her name, but always calls her merely "the wife of Uba-aner." But
      behind all this there is probably the remains of a very different system.
      The servant employed by the mistress seems to see nothing outrageous in
      her proceed-5</span>

      <span class="font14 c7">ings; and even the steward, who is on the master's
      side, waits a day or two before reporting matters. When we remember the
      supremacy in properly and descent which women held in Egypt, and then read
      this tale, it seems that it belongs to the close of a social system like
      that of the Nairs, in which the lady makes her selection&mdash;with
      variations from time to time. The incident of sending a present of
      clothing is curiously like the tale about a certain English envoy, whose
      proprieties were sadly ruffled in the Nair country, when a lady sent him a
      grand shawl with an intimation of her choice. The priestesses of Amen
      retained to the last this privilege of choice, as being under divine, and
      not human protection; but it seems to have become unseemly in late times.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">The hinging of this tale, and of those that follow
      it, upon the use of magic, shows how thoroughly the belief in magic</span>

      <span class="font15 c7">powers was ingrained in the Egyptians. Now such a
      belief implies the presence of magicians, and shows how familiar must have
      been the claim to such powers, and the practising of the tricks of
      witchcraft, so prevalent in Africa in modern times. The efficacy of a
      model, such as this crocodile of wax, is an idea continually met with in
      Egypt. The system of tomb furniture and decoration, of <i>ka</i> statues,
      of <i>ushabtis</i> or figures to work for the deceased, and the models
      placed in foundation deposits, all show how a model was supposed to have
      the efficacy of an actual reality. Even in the latest tale of all (written
      in Ptolemaic times), Setnau makes a model of a boat and men, to be sunk in
      the river to work for him. The reconversion of the crocodile to wax, on
      being taken up by the magician, reminds us of the serpent becoming again a
      rod when taken up by Aaron.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The punishment

      incident. The place of the penalty, in front of the harem, or the private
      portion of the palace, was evidently for the intimidation of other ladies.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">At the close of each tale, King Khufu, to whom it
      is told, orders funerary offerings by the usual formula, to be presented
      in honour of the king under whom the wonder took place. On the tablets of
      the tombs in the early times, there is usually recorded the offering&mdash;or,
      rather, the pious desire that there should be offered&mdash;thousands of
      loaves, of oxen, of gazelles, of cranes, &amp;c., for a deceased person.
      Such expression cost no more by the thousand than by the dozen, so
      thousands came to be the usual expression in all ordaining of offerings.</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">We are so accustomed to think of tedium as
      something modern, that it seems strange to find in the oldest tales [Page
      16] in the world how the first king of whom we know anything was bored by
      his pleasures. A reward for discovering a new pleasure is the very basis
      of the tale of Sneferu; and the wise man's remedy of a day in the country
      is still the best resource, though all that we know as human history has
      tried its experiments in enjoyment since then. The flavour of the ballet
      thrown in, by the introduction of the damsels of the household clad in
      fishing nets, is not yet obsolete in modern amusements; and even in this
      century Muhammed Ali had resource to the same way of killing time, as he
      was rowed about by his <i>harem,</i> but on an artificial lake.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">The use of two large oars for steering explains
      the detail of the story. The oars were one on each side of the stern, and</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">were each managed by a steerer. From the tale we
      see that the steerer led the song of the rowers, and if the leader ceased,
      all that side of the boat ceased also.. The position of the lost jewel
      upon the hair shows that it was in a fillet set with inlaying, like that
      seen on early figures, such as Nefert at Medum, who wears a fillet of
      rosettes to retain the hair; and the position of the steering oar attached
      to a post, with the handle rising high in the air, explains how it could
      strike the fillet and displace the jewel.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The
      last tale is really double, a tale within a tale. It begins with the
      wonders done by</span> <span class="font14 c16">Dedi, and then goes on
      with the [Page 22]</span> <span class="font14 c7">history or the children
      about whom</span> <span class="font14 c7">he prophesied to Khufu.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">The village of Dedi was probably near Medum, as in
      the temple of Sneferu at Medum an offering was found presented by a
      worshipper to the gods of Ded-sneferu:</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">hence the background which is here given for the
      scene of Hordedef leading old Dedi. The translation of "the designs of the
      dwelling of Tahuti" is not certain; but the passage seems to refer to some
      architectural plan which was desired for the pyramid.</span> <span
      class="font14 c7">The story of Rud-didet is remarkable historically. She
      is said to be wife of the priest of Ra, her children are sons of Ra, and
      they are the first three kings of the Vth dynasty, and supplanted the line
      of Khufu. This points to the Vth Dynasty having been a priestly
      usurpation; and on looking at its history we see two confirmations of
      this. The title "Son of Ra" is so common in most ages in Egypt that it is
      taken for granted, and is applied in lists to any second cartouche; but it
      is not found until well into the Vth Dynasty; the earlier kings were not
      descendants of Ra, and it is only on arriving at this dynasty, which
      claimed descent from Ra, through the wife</span>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">of the priest of Ra, that we find the claim of
      each king to be a "son of Ra." Another confirmation of this priestly
      descent is the abundance of priesthoods established for the kings of the
      Vth Dynasty; a care which agrees with their having a priestly origin;
      while in the tale it is particularly said that they would build up the
      temples, furnish the altars with offerings, supply the tables of
      libations, and increase the religious endowments.</span> <span
      class="font14 c7">The names of the three children are a play upon the
      names of the first three kings of the Vth Dynasty. User-kaf is made into
      User-ref; Sahu-ra is written Sah-ra; and Kaka is Kaku; thus making
      allusions to their births. The comparison of the hair to true lapis lazuli
      seems very strange; but there is often a confusion between black aind blue
      in uneducated races, and <i>azrak</i> means either dark blue or green, or
      black, at present in Arabic. Lapis lazuli is brought in to the name of the
      queen of Ramessu</span>

      recalling the comparison here of personal beauty to these precious
      materials.</span> <span class="font14 c7">It is noticeable here that in a
      tale of the Vth Dynasty, certainly written as early as the XlIth Dynasty,
      we find professional dancers commonly recognised, and going on travels
      through the country, with a porter.</span> <span class="font14 c7">From
      this tale we also learn that Egyptian women underwent a purification of
      fourteen days, during which they kept apart and did not attend to any
      household matters. The mistress of the house here inquires if the
      preparations are made for the feast on her return to household affairs;
      and hears then how the beer cannot be made for lack of the barley.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">The securing of the sack is just in accord with
      the remains of this early period; the use of boxes, of thongs of leather
      for tying and of clay sealings for securing property, were all familiar
      matters in the XlIth Dynasty, as we learn from Kahun.</span>

      <span class="font14 c7">The present close of the tale is evidently only a
      stage in it, when the treacherous maid meets with the common doom of the
      wicked in Egyptian romance. How it was continued is a matter of
      speculation, but Khufu ought certainly to reappear and to order great
      rewards for Dedi, who up to this has only had maintenance on his requisite
      scale provided for him. Yet it is imperative that the children shall be
      saved from his wrath, as they are the kings of the Vth Dynasty. There may
      be a long episode lost of their flight and adventures.</span> <span
      class="font14 c7">One reference to a date needs notice. The 25th of the
      month Tybi is said to be the predicted birthday of the children; and Khufu
      refers to going to Sakhebu about that time apparently, when the banks of
      the canal are cut and the land was drying after the inundation, whereon
      Dedi threatens that the water shall still be deep there. This points to
      25th Tybi being about the close of the inundation. This would be about</span>

      Dynasty, and also in the XIIth Dynasty, when the papyrus was perhaps
      written: hence there is nothing conclusive to be drawn from this allusion
      so far. But when we compare this tale with those following, we see good
      ground for its belonging to a time before the XIIth Dynasty The following
      tale of the peasant and the workman evidently belongs to the IXth or Xth
      Dynasties, when Herakleopolis was the capital, and Sanehat is certainly of
      the XIIth Dynasty. Yet in those we see character and incident made the
      basis of interest, in place of the childish profusion of marvels of the
      Tales of the Magicians. It seems impossible not to suppose that they
      belong to very different ages and canons of taste; and hence we cannot
      refer the crudities ot the Khufu tales to the time of the far more
      elaborate and polished recital of the adventures of Sanehat in the XIIth
      Dynasty. Being thus obliged to suppose an earlier date for these tales,

      was a serf of the High Steward Meruitensa. Now said this Hemti, when he
      saw the asses of Sekhti, that were pleasing in his eyes, "Oh that some
      good god would grant me to steal away the goods of Sekhti from him!"</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">Now the Hemti's house was by the dyke of the
      tow-path, which was straitened, and not wide, as much as the width of a
      waist cloth: on the one side of it was the water, and on the other side of
      it grew his corn. Hemti said then to his servant, "Hasten I bring me a
      shawl from the house," and it was brought instantly. Then spread he out
      this shawl on the face of the dyke, and it lay with its fastening on the
      water and its fringe on the corn.</span> <span class="font14 c7">Now
      Sekhti approached along the path used by all men. Said Hemti, "Have a
      care, Sekhti! you are not going to trample on my clothes! "Said Sekhti, "I
      will do</span>

      up on the higher side. But Hemti said, "Go you over my corn, instead of
      the path?" Said Sekhti, "I am going carefully; this high field of corn is
      not my choice, but you have stopped your path with your clothes, and will
      you then not let us pass by the side of the path?" And one of the asses
      filled its mouth with a cluster of corn. Said Hemti, "Look you, I shall
      take away your ass, Sekhti, for eating my corn; behold it will have to pay
      according to the amount of the injury." Said Sekhti, "I am going
      carefully; the one way is stopped, therefore took I my ass by the enclosed
      ground, and do you seize it for filling its mouth with a cluster of corn?
      Moreover, I know unto whom this domain belongs, even unto the Lord Steward
      Meruitensa. He it is who smites every robber in this whole land; and shall
      I then be robbed in his domain?"</span> <span class="font14 c7">Said

      Lord Steward of whom you think." Thereon he took to him branches of green
      tamarisk and scourged all his limbs, took his asses, and drave them into
      the pasture. And Sekhti wept very greatly, by reason of the pain of what
      he had suffered. Said Hemti, "Lift not up your voice, Sekhti, or you shall
      go to the Demon of Silence." Sekhti answered, "You beat me, you steal my
      goods, and now would take away even my voice, O demon of silence! If you
      will restore my goods, then will I cease to cry out at your violence."</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">Sekhti stayed the whole day petitioning Hemti, but
      he would not give ear unto him. And Sekhti went his way to Khenensuten to
      complain to the Lord Steward Meruitensa. He found him coming out from the
      door of his house to embark on his boat, that he might go to the judgment
      hall. Sekhti said, "Ho! turn, that I may please thy heart with this

      that is our custom. Then it will be fitting to beat this Hemti for a
      trifle of natron and a trifle of salt; if he is commanded to pay for it,
      he will pay for it." But the High Steward Meruitensa held his peace; for
      he would not reply unto these nobles, but would reply unto the Sekhti.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">Now Sekhti came to appeal to the Lord Steward
      Meruitensa, and said, " O my Lord Steward, greatest of the great, guide of

      and two draughts of beer each day; which the Lord Steward Meruitensa
      provided for him, giving it to a friend of his, who furnished it unto him.
      Then the Lord Steward Meruitensa sent the governor of the Sekhet Hemat to
      make provision for the wife of the Sekhti, three rations of corn each day.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">Then came the Sekhti a second time, and even a

      Sekhti feared that he should be beaten as at the third request. But the
      Lord Steward Meruitensa then said unto him, "Fear not, Sekhti, for what

      Meruitensa made two of his followers to go to the Sekhet Hemat, and bring
      a list of the household of the Sekhti; and its amount was six persons,
      beside his oxen and his goats, his wheat and his barley, his asses and his
      dogs; and moreover he gave all that which belonged unto the Hemti to the
      Sekhti, even all his property and his offices, and the Sekhti was beloved
      of the king more than all his overseers, and ate of all the good things of

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font14"><i>REMARKS</i> Of the tale of the peasant and the
      workman three copies, more or less imperfect, remain to us. At Berlin are
      two papyri, Nos. 2 and 4, containing parts of the tale, published in
      facsimile in the "Denkmaler" of Lepsius vi. 108-110 and 113; while
      portions of another copy exist in the Butler papyrus; and lately fragments
      of the same have been collated in the collection of Lord Amherst of
      Hackney. These last have been published in the Proceedings of the Society
      of Biblical Archaeology, xiv. 558. The number of copies seem to show that
      this was a popular tale in early times; it certainly is of a more advanced
      type than the earlier tales of magic, though it belongs to a simpler style
      than the tales which follow. It has been translated partially by Chabas
      and Goodwin, and also by Maspero, but most completely by Griffith in the
      Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, referred to above.</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">The beginning of the tale is lost in all the
      copies, and an introductory sentence is here added in brackets, to explain
      the position of affairs at the opening of the fragment. The essence of the
      tale is the difference in social position between the Sekhti, or peasant,
      and the Hemti, or workman&mdash;the <i>fellah</i> and the client of the
      noble; and the impossibility of getting justice against a client, unless
      by some extraordinary means of attracting his patron's attention, is the
      basis of the action. There is not a single point of incident here which
      might not be true in modern times; every turn of it seems to live, as one
      reads it in view of country life in Egypt.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The
      region of the tale is Henenseten, or Herakleopolis, now Ahnas, a little
      south of the Fayum. This was the seat of the IXth and Xth Dynasties,
      apparently ejected from Memphis by a foreign invasion of the Delta; and
      here it is that the High Steward lives and goes to speak to the king. The
      district of the Sekhti is indicated by his travelling</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">south to Henenseten, and going with asses and not
      by boat. Hence we are led to look for the Sekhet Hemat, or salt country,
      in the borders of the Fayum lake, whence the journey would be southward,
      and across the desert. This lake was not regulated artificially until the
      XIIth Dynasty; and hence at the period of this tale it was a large sheet
      of water, fluctuating with each rise and fall of the Nile, and bordered by
      lagoons where rushes would flourish, and where salt and natron would
      accumulate daring the dry season of each year. At the present time the
      lake of the Fayum is brackish, and the cliffs which border it contain so
      much salt that rain pools which collect on them are not drinkable. The
      paths and roads of Egypt are not protected by law as in Western countries.
      Each person encroaches on a path or diverts it as may suit his purpose,
      only checked by the liberties taken by passers-by in trespassing if a path
      be insufficient. Hence, it is very usual to see a house built over half of
      a path,</span>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">and driving the traffic into the field or almost
      over the river bank. In this case the Hemti had taken in as much of the
      path as he could, and left it but a narrow strip along the top of the
      canal bank. The frequent use of the public way for drying clothes, or
      spreading out property, gave the idea of choking the way altogether, and
      leaving no choice but trespassing on the crops. No sooner does a donkey
      pause, or even pass, by a field of corn than he snatches a mouthful, and
      in a delay or altercation such as this the beast is sure to take the
      advantage. Donkeys carrying loads by cornfields are usually muzzled with
      rope nets, to prevent their feeding; and even sheep and goats are also
      fended in the same way.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The proverb, "A
      poor man's name is only his own matter," refers to the independent <i>fellah</i>
      having no patron or protector who will take up and defend his name from
      accusations, as the interests of clients and serfs would be protected.

      <span class="font14 c7">The scene of Meruitensa laying the case before the
      nobles who sat with him is interesting as showing that even simple cases
      were not decided by one judge, but referred to a council. Similarly, Una
      lays stress on the private trial of the queen being confided to him and
      only one other judge. Apparently, referring cases to a bench of judges was
      the means of preventing corruption.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The
      speeches of the Sekhti were given at full length in the papyrus, but owing
      to injuries we cannot now entirely recover them; they are all in much the
      same strain, only the first and last are translated here, and the others
      are passed over. The style of these speeches was evidently looked on as
      eloquent in those days, and this papyrus really seems to show the time
      when long-drawn comparisons and flowery wishes were in fashion. It is far
      different from later compositions, as it is also from the earlier simple</span>

      <span class="font14 c7">"Inventaire de la collection Egyptienne (Ermitage
      Imperial)," p. 177-182.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The tale is that of
      a returned sailor, speaking to his superior and telling his adventures, to
      induce him to send him on with an introduction to the king. At first his
      master professes to disbelieve him, and then the sailor protests that this
      happened to himself, and gives his narrative. The idea of an enchanted
      island, which has risen from the waves and will sink again, is here found
      to be one of the oldest plots for a tale of marvels. But the construction
      is far more advanced than that of the tales of the magicians. The family
      of serpents and the manner of the great serpent is well conceived, and
      there are many fine touches of literary quality: such as noise as of
      thunder, the trees shaking and the earth being moved at the appearance of
      the great serpent&mdash;the speeches of the serpent and his threat&mdash;the
      sailors who had seen heaven and earth&mdash;the contempt of the serpent
      for his offerings.</span>

      a firm hand and practised taste, although there is still a style of
      simplicity clinging to it which agrees well to its date in the XIIth
      Dynasty.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The great serpent is not of a type
      usual in Egyptian designs. The human-headed uraeus is seldom bearded; and
      the best example of such a monster is on an Ethiopian temple, where a
      great uraeus has human arms and a lion's head. The colours again repeat
      the favourite combination expressive of splendour&mdash;gold and lazuli.
      Though lazuli is very rare in early times, yet it certainly was known in
      the XIIth Dynasty, as shown by the forms of some beads of lazuli.</span>

      papyrus de Berlin," 37-51), Goodwin, and Maspero ("Mel. d'arch.," iii. 68,
      140, and "Contes Populaire," 89-130); while the beginning is treated in

      as the biographical inscriptions of the early tombs. Possibly some day the
      tomb of Sanehat may be found, and the whole inscription be read complete
      upon the walls.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The name Sa-nehat means
      "son of the sycamore," probably from his having been born, or living, at
      some place where was a celebrated sacred sycamore. This was a common tree
      in ancient, as in modern, Egypt; but an allusion in the tale, to Sanehat
      turning his back on the sycamore, when he was fleeing apparently up the
      west side of the Delta, makes it probable that the sycamore was that of
      Aa-tenen, now Batnun, at the middle of the west side of the Delta.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">The titles given to Sanehat at the opening are of
      a very high rank, and imply that he was the son either of the king or of a
      great noble. And his position in the queen's household shows him to have
      been of importance; the manner in which he is received 10</span>

      was quite familiar with them in early days.</span> <span class="font14 c7">But
      the great difficulty in the account has been the sudden panic of Sanehat
      on hearing of the death of Amenemhat, and no explanation of this has yet
      been brought forward. It seems not unlikely that he was a son of Amenemhat
      by some concubine. This would at once account for his high titles&mdash;for
      his belonging to the royal household&mdash;for his fear of his elder
      brother Usertesen, who might see in him a rival, and try to slay him after
      his father's death&mdash;for the command to him to leave all his
      possessions and family behind him in Syria, as the condition of his being
      allowed to return to end his days in Egypt&mdash;for his familiar
      reception by the royal family, and for the property given to him on his
      return.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The date recorded for the death of

      manner in which a king's decease was regarded; under the emblem of a hawk&mdash;the
      bird of Ra&mdash;he flew up and joined the sun.</span> <span
      class="font14 c7">Sometime before his death Amenemhat had been in
      retirement; after twenty years of reign (which was probably rather late in
      his life, as he seems to have forced his way to the front as a successful
      man and founder of a family) he had associated his son, the first
      Usertesen, on the throne, and apparently resigned active life; for in the
      third year of Usertesen we find the coregent summoning his court and
      decreeing the founding of the temple of Heliopolis without any mention of
      his father. The old king, however, lived yet ten years after his
      retirement, and died (as this narrative shows us) during an expedition of
      his son Usertesen.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The time of year
      mentioned here would fall in about the middle of the inundation in those
      days. Hence it seems that the military expeditions were made after the

      the population disengaged from other labour.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The
      course of Sanehat's flight southward, reaching the Nile at Cairo after two
      days' haste, indicates that the army was somewhere west of the Delta. This
      would point to its being on the road to the oasis of the Natron Lakes,
      which would be the natural course for a body of men needing water supply.
      His throwing himself between two bushes to hide from the army shows that
      the message came early in the day, otherwise he would have fled in the
      dark. He then fled a day's journey to the south, turning his back on the
      sycamore, and slept in the open field at Shi-Seneferu somewhere below the
      Barrage. The second day he reached the Nile opposite Old Cairo in the
      afternoon, and ferried himself over, passed the quarries at Gebel
      Mokattam, and the red hill of Gebel Ahmar, and came to a frontier wall
      before dark. This cannot have been far from Old Cairo, by the time;</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">and as Heliopolis was in course of building by
      Usertesen, it would be probably on the desert near there, for the
      protection of the town. Passing the desert guards by night he pushed on
      and reached Peten, near Belbeis, by dawn, and turned east toward the
      valley of Kemur, or Wady Tumilat. Here in his extremity he was found by
      the Sati or Asiatics, and rescued. This shows that the eastern desert was
      left to the wandering tribes, and was without any regular government at
      this period; though all the eastern Delta was already well in Egyptian
      hands, as we know by the monuments at Bubastis, Dedamun, and Tanis.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">The land of Adim to which Sanehat fled appears to
      be the same as Edom or the southeast corner of Syria. It was evidently
      near the upper Tenu, or Rutennu, who seem to have dwelt on the hill
      country of Palestine. The hill and the plain of Palestine are so markedly
      different, that in all ages they have tended to be held by opposing
      people. In</span>

    <p>
      <span class="font14 c7">the time of Sanehat the upper Tenu who held the
      hills were opposed to the Tenu in general who held the plains; later on
      the Semites of the hills opposed the Philistines of the plain, and now the
      <i>fellah</i> of the hills opposes the Bedawi of the plain. The district
      of Amuanshi in which Sanehat settled was a goodly land, bearing figs and
      grapes and olives, flowing with wine and honey and oil, yielding barley
      and wheat without end, and much cattle. This abundance points rather to
      the hill country near Hebron or between there and Belt Jibrin, as this
      south part of the hills is notably fertile. The Tenu who came to defy
      Sanehat, being in opposition to the upper Tenu, were probably those of the
      plain; and the opposition to Sanehat may have arisen from his encroaching
      on the fertile plain at the foot of his hills, as he was in the best of
      the land "on the border of the next land."</span> <span class="font14 c7">The
      Egyptian was evidently looked on as being of a superior race by the Tenu,

      <span class="font14 c7">his civilisation won for him the confidence which
      many wandering Englishmen now find in Africa or Polynesia, like John Dunn.
      The set combat of two champions seems&mdash;by the large gathering&mdash;to
      have been a well-recognised custom among the Tenu, while it exactly
      accords with Goliath's offer in later times. And raising the shout of
      victory on the back of the fallen champion reminds us of David's standing
      on Goliath.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The transition from the recital
      of the Syrian adventures to the petition to Pharaoh is not marked in the
      manuscript; but from the construction the beginning of the petition is
      evidently at the place here marked. The manner in which Sanehat appeals to
      the queen shows how well he must have been known to her in his former
      days.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The decree in reply to Sanehat is in
      the regular style of royal decrees of the period. Apparently by a clerical
      error the scribe has substituted the name Amenemhat for Userte-sen, but
      the Horus name and the throne name</span>

      The tone of the reply is as gracious as possible, according with the
      king's character as stated by Sanehat, "He is a friend of great sweetness,
      and knows how to gain love." He quite recognises the inquiries after the
      queen, and replies concerning her. And then he assures Sanehat of welcome
      on his return, and promises him all that he asks, including a tomb "in the
      company of the royal children," a full recognition of his real rank.
      Incidentally we learn that the Amu buried their dead wrapped in a sheep's
      skin; as we also learn, further on, that they anointed themselves with oil
      (olive?), wore the hair long, and slept on the ground.</span> <span
      class="font14 c7">The funeral that is promised accords with the burials of
      the XIIth Dynasty: the gilded case, the head painted blue, and the canopy
      of cypress wood, are all known of this period, but would be out of place
      in describing a Ramesside burial.</span> <span class="font14 c7">Sanehat's

      hard to be certain where his petition begins; possibly the opening of it
      has been lost out of the text in copying from a mutilated papyrus; or
      possibly it was sent merely as a memorandum of Sanehat's position and
      desires, without venturing to address it personally to the king; or even
      it may have not been allowable then to make such petitions formally, so as
      to leave the initiative to the king's free will, just as it is not
      allowable nowadays to question royalty, but only to answer when spoken to.</span>
      <span class="font14 c7">The proposal to bring forward his fellow-sheikhs
      as witnesses of his unabated loyalty is very curious, and seems
      superfluous after Usertesen's assurances. Beyond Abisha of the Amu at Beni
      Hasan, these are the only early personal names of Syrians that we know.
      The Fenkhu in this connection can hardly be other than the Phoenicians;
      and, if so, this points to their being already estab-</span>

      <span class="font14 c7">lished in southern Syria at this date. But these
      chiefs were not allowed to come forward; and it seems to have been the
      policy of Egypt to keep the Syrians off as much as possible, not a single
      man who came with Sanehat being allowed to cross the frontier. The
      allusion to the Tenu belonging to Pharaoh, like his dogs, is peculiarly
      fitting to this period, as the dog seems to have been more familiarly
      domesticated in the XIth and XIIth Dynasties than at any other age, and
      dogs are often then represented on the funereal steles, even with their
      names.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The expression for strangeness&mdash;"as
      a man of the Delta sees himself at the cataract, as a man of the plain who
      sees himself in the deserts"&mdash;is true to this day. Nothing upsets an
      Egyptian's self-reliance like going back a few miles into the desert; and
      almost any man of the cultivated plain will flee with terror if he finds
      himself left alone far in the desert, or even taken to the top of the
      desert hills. .</span>

      <span class="font14 c7">We learn incidentally that the Egyptian frontier,
      even in the later years of Usertesen I., had not been pushed beyond the
      Wady Tumilat; for Sanehat travels south to the Roads of Horus, where he
      finds the frontier garrison, and leaves his Syrian friends; and there
      laden boats meet him, showing that it must have been somewhere along a
      waterway from the Nile.</span> <span class="font14 c7">The abasement of
      Sanehat might well be due to natural causes, beside the reverence for the
      divine person of the king. The Egyptian court must have seemed
      oppressively splendid, with the brilliant and costly workmanship of
      Usertesen, to one who had lived a half-wild life for so many years; and,
      more than that, the recalling of all his early days and habits and
      friendships would overwhelm his mind and make it difficult to collect his
      thoughts.</span> <span class="font14 c7">Sanehat's appearance was so much

      collars and sceptres in the song and dance is not clear to us. The sistra
      were, of course, to beat or rattle in time with the song; the sceptres or
      wands were perhaps the same as the engraved wands of ivory common in the
      XIIth Dynasty, or of blue glazed ware in XVIIIth, and would be used to
      wave or beat time with; but the use of the collar and counterpoise, or <i>menat,</i>
      is unexplained, though figures of dancers are shown holding a collar and

      case, we have here an invaluable picture of life in Palestine and in
      Egypt, and the relations of the two countries, at an epoch before the time
      of Abraham, and not paralleled by any other document until more than a
      thousand years later.</span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
